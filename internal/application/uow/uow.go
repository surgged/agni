// Package uow defines the Unit of Work abstraction used by the application's
// command handlers to persist an aggregate and publish the events it recorded
// as a single atomic operation.
//
// These interfaces live in the application layer (rather than internal/ports)
// because they are expressed in terms of domain repositories and domain
// events. In a layered/DDD design the application layer legitimately depends
// on the domain, so this is the natural home for a port that hands out
// transaction-scoped domain repositories.

// TxRepositories provides transaction-scoped domain repositories to the
// closure passed to UnitOfWork.SaveAndPublish. Each accessor returns a
// repository bound to the active transaction, so every write performed
// through it participates in the same atomic unit as the outbox append.
//
// Command handlers obtain repositories from this port instead of
// constructing concrete adapters, so the application layer no longer needs
// to import the persistence adapter or *gorm.DB directly.

// UnitOfWork abstracts the atomicity boundary between persisting an
// aggregate and publishing the events it recorded. Implementations decide
// whether the operations are wrapped in a database transaction (the outbox
// pattern) or run sequentially.
//
// Command handlers use this port instead of calling repo.Save and
// bus.Publish directly so the same code can run against either backend
// without modification.

	// then publishes the recorded events. The closure receives a
	// TxRepositories that hands out repositories bound to the active
	// transaction, so the application layer never touches the persistence
	// adapter or *gorm.DB directly. The closure runs first; the returned
	// error short-circuits the publish step. The events slice is consumed
	// even on error paths so the caller does not need to reset the
	// aggregate's internal buffer.
