# Common development tasks (build, run, dev, test, fmt, vet, tidy, swag, migrate)
# are provided by the `crank` CLI, so they are intentionally NOT duplicated here.
# Run `crank tools` to list them. This Makefile holds only targets that crank does
# not provide natively — add your own project-specific targets below. They can be
# run with either `make <target>` or `crank <target>` (crank transparently
# delegates unknown commands to this Makefile).
